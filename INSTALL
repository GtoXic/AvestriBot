1 REQUIREMENTS
To run AvestriBot you need a few things.
AvestriForums
MySQL
PHP
PHP-CLI

That's all you need, You can get MySQL, PHP and PHP-CLI from searching google.

2 INSTALLATION
You will need to read this carefully if you do not want to damage the bot and if you do not want to go searching for everything.
2.1
1st: Head to ./core/ and open config.php.
You should see something like this:
<?php
$config = array(
"server"  => "irc.x10hosting.com", //Server IP/Hostname
"port"    => 6667, //Server Port
"channel" => "#avestribot", //Channel
"name"    => "AvestriBot", //Bot's Realname
"nick"    => "AvestriBot", //Bot's Nickname
"pass"    => "", //Nickserv password (if applicable)
"owner"   => "GtoXic",
//MYSQL INFO
"sqlhost" => "localhost", //MySQL Server IP/Hostname
"sqlport" => "3306", //MySQL Port (Leave this one alone if you don't know it)
"sqluser" => "root", //MySQL Username
"sqlpass" => "", //MySQL Password 
"db_name" => "gothx_community", //MySQL Database Name
"db_pref" => "af_", //MySQL Table prefix (eg: [af_]members the text in the [] been the prefix) This can be empty
);
?>
Fill in all of the details needed to set the bot up.
2nd: Save the file and open a terminal (Linux) or CMD (Windows)
LINUX:
cd to the folder where bot.php is stored (AvestriBot's root)
Type: php bot.php
You should see the bot connect and show the IRC's MOTD etc like you would see through your client.
If the bot crashes, it should output a message telling you what happened, we request you provide that through an issue on github to one of the developers or support staff.
WINDOWS:
find where you put your PHP installation and remember it.
cd to the folder where bot.php is stored (AvestriBot's root)
Type: PATH TO PHP\php-cgi.exe bot.php
If that gives a 404 Not Found then type the full path to bot.php.
You should see the bot connect and show the IRC's MOTD etc like you would see through your client.

3 MODULES
Modules are what drive the bot's commands, they can be as basic as sending a message to a channel to checking if people are admins, getting data from locations, reading logs, configuring bot settings and more.
3.1 INSTALLING MODULES
installing modules is pretty easy.
1st: goto ./cmd/ and open main.php
2nd: add
case "{$p}COMMANDNAME":
	include("./cmd/COMMANDNAME/main.php");
	break;
3rd: add the module file(s) to ./cmd/
4th: test the command.
NOTE: You should not need to restart the bot as the bot uses seperate files that are called everytime a message is recieved, main.php been one of them.
3.2 GETTING MORE MODULES
You can get more modules from http://avestribot.co.cc/modules/. This page has a full list of modules both official (made by the AvestriBot Team) and unofficial (made by AvestriBot users). All of them carry instructions similar to 3.1 of this INSTALL guide.
3.3 DEVELOPING MODULES
You can develop your own modules in a few minutes.
3.3.1 BASIC DEVELOPMENT
1st: create ./cmd/MODULENAME as a directory
2nd: enter ./cmd/MODULENAME
3rd: add a new file and call it main.php
4th: create an INSTALL file in that folder with the details of how to install your file including adding the content to ./cmd/main.php.
5th: edit your ./cmd/main.php and ./cmd/MODULENAME/main.php
N.B: You can add as many files as you want into your ./cmd/MODULENAME/ directory.
3.3.2 FUNCTIONS YOU CAN CALL
You can call any functions, even your own, just prefix the functions with $this-> (or if they are static: self:: works too)
get_level(<nick> as string);
query(<mysql query> as string, [mysql_connection] as mysql connection);
send_data(<command> as string, [message] as string);
join_channel(<channel> as string or array);
error(<message> as string, <level> as int);
